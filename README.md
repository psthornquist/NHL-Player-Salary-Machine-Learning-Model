### This model will attempt to determine what each NHL player should be earning, while also identifying overvalued and undervalued players.

## Project Description

Our project will attempt to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict a player's salary, based on their statistics. We will also categorize all players using clustering to determine where they stand in a group of similar player types, which will allow us to see if the player is under or overvalued. 

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks

1. Get dataset with all active players from 2021-22 season, including all player information, statisics, and salaries.
2. Train and test machine learning model to determine the estimated salary for each player.
3. Group players into clusters of similar player types.
4. Use machine learning model to predict who will have the best statistics next year, such as most goals, assists, and points.
5. Create visualizations and a dashboard to properly present the data.
