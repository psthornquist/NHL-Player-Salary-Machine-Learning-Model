Have been attempting to use different activation functions, but seems to have similar outputs

Using about 60 inputs

Attempted to increase number of neurons from 1500 to 3000, but it increased the mean squared error

instead tried adding an additional layer with 1500 neurons, same result

Seems like having too small a network, AND too small a network increases our loss

Going to try a deep network with at least 5 layers
